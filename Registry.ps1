<#Basic about several registries:
HKLM: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE makes up the windows registry. This hive contains majority of the

HKCU: HKEY_CURRENT_USER  contains configuration information of windows relevant of the user logged in.
(specifically the current user)
for eg: Installed printers, desktop wallpaper etc.
